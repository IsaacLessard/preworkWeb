			<p>I gradauted high school in Fruita, Colorado, and have been slowly finishing a double major,<b> Business Administration, Information Systems Management,</b> online while travelling and working. I have <b><i>finished</i></b> a certificate program in <b>Project Management</b>.</p>
			<p>Recently moved back to Colorado from Tokyo, where I was an English teacher, math tutor, PE teacher, a guitarist in a Japanese rock band, and a bilingual accountant for international schools and non-profits. I'm staying at my relative's house in <b>Castle Rock</b> while I finish this school.</p>

			<p>While in Tokyo, I was handed a website to manage as I was the only one with <b><i>IT experience... </i> </b> this lead me to discover I am passionate about coding. I plan to turn this passion into a career, and to help non-profits in a more professional manner.</p>
